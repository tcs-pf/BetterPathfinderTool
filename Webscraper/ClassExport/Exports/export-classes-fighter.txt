p - Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of 
p - armor
p - , learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.
p - Role
p - : Fighters excel at combat—defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.
p - Alignment
p - : Any.
p - Hit Die
p - : d10.
p - Starting Wealth

p - The following are class features of the fighter.
p - A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).
p - At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as 
p - Combat Feats
p - , sometimes also called “fighter bonus feats.”
p - Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.
p - Can I use the Bonus Feats class feature to retrain a feat that I gained at 1st level (such as 
p - Cleave
p - ) to gain a feat that I did not qualify for at 1st level, but do qualify for now (such as 
p - Lunge
p - Yes. So long as the feat that you “lose” is not used as a prerequisite for any other feat, prestige class, or other ability, you can gain any feat that you qualify for at the time that you retrain it.
p - Source
p - Starting at 2nd level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on 
p - Will
p -  saves against fear. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd.
p - Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing 
p - armor
p - , he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum –4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum 
p - Dexterity
p -  bonus allowed.
p - In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.
p - Advanced Armor Training
p - : Beginning at 7th level, instead of increasing the benefits provided by armor training (reducing his armor’s check penalty by 1 and increasing its maximum 
p - Dexterity
p -  bonus by 1), a fighter can choose an advanced armor training option (see 
p - Advanced Armor Training
p -  below) . If the fighter does so, he still gains the ability to move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor at 3rd level, and while wearing heavy armor at 7th level. 
p - Source
p - PZO9467
p - Starting at 5th level, a fighter can select one group of weapons, as noted below. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.
p - Every four levels thereafter (9th*, 13th, and 17th), a fighter becomes further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.
p - A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from his group. This bonus also applies to the fighter’s Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group.
p - Advanced Weapon Training
p - : Beginning at 9th level, instead of selecting an additional fighter weapon group, a fighter can choose an advanced weapon training option (see 
p - Advanced Weapon Training
p -  below) for one fighter weapon group that he previously selected with the weapon training class feature.

p -  5/— whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.
p - At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (×2 becomes ×3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.
p - Source
p - PZO9467
p - Highly skilled and tenacious fighters can gain advanced armor training, learning techniques and applications of the armor training class feature that give them special benefits in exchange for reducing their ability to mitigate their armor’s armor check penalty and improve its maximum 
p - Dexterity
p -  bonus.
p - Advanced armor training options function only when the fighter is wearing appropriate armor or using a shield, unless otherwise noted. A fighter with an archetype that replaces armor training cannot select advanced armor training options.
p - Adaptable Training (Ex)
p - : The fighter can use his 
p - base attack bonus
p -  in place of his ranks in one skill of his choice from the following list: 
p - Acrobatics
p - Climb
p - Disguise
p - Escape Artist
p - Intimidate
p - Knowledge
p -  (engineering), 
p - Profession
p -  (soldier), 
p - Ride
p - , or 
p - Swim
p - . The fighter need not be wearing armor or using a shield to use this option. When using adaptable training, the fighter substitutes his total 
p - base attack bonus
p -  (including his 
p - base attack bonus
p -  gained through levels in other classes) for his ranks in this skill, but adds the skill’s usual ability score modifier and any other bonuses or penalties that would modify that skill. Once a skill has been selected, it cannot be changed and the fighter can immediately retrain all of his ranks in the selected skill at no additional cost in money or time. In addition, the fighter adds all skills chosen with this option to his list of class skills. A fighter can choose this option up to four times.
p - Armor Specialization (Ex)
p - : The fighter selects one specific type of armor with which he is proficient, such as chain shirts or scale mail. While wearing the selected type of 
p - armor
p - , the fighter adds one-quarter of his fighter level to the armor’s 
p - armor bonus
p - , up to a maximum bonus of +3 for light 
p - armor
p - , +4 for medium 
p - armor
p - , or +5 for heavy armor. This increase to the 
p - armor bonus
p -  doesn’t increase the benefit that the fighter gains from feats, class abilities, or other effects that are determined by his armor’s base 
p - armor bonus
p - , including other advanced armor training options. A fighter can choose this option multiple times. Each time he chooses it, he applies its benefit to a different type of armor.
p - Armored Confidence (Ex)
p - : While wearing 
p - armor
p - , the fighter gains a bonus on 
p - Intimidate
p -  checks based upon the type of armor he is wearing: +1 for light 
p - armor
p - , +2 for medium 
p - armor
p - , or +3 for heavy armor. This bonus increases by 1 at 7th level and every 4 fighter levels thereafter, to a maximum of +4 at 19th level. In addition, the fighter adds half his armored confidence bonus to the DC of 
p - Intimidate
p -  checks to demoralize him.
p - Armored Juggernaut (Ex)
p - : When wearing heavy 
p - armor
p - , the fighter gains 
p -  1/—. At 7th level, the fighter gains 
p -  1/— when wearing medium 
p - armor
p - , and 
p -  2/— when wearing heavy armor. At 11th level, the fighter gains 
p -  1/— when wearing light 
p - armor
p -  2/— when wearing medium 
p - armor
p - , and 
p -  3/— when wearing heavy armor. If the fighter is 19th level and has the armor mastery class feature, these 
p -  values increase by 5. The 
p -  from this ability stacks with that provided by 
p - adamantine
p - armor
p - , but not with other forms of 
p - damage reduction
p - . This 
p - damage reduction
p -  does not apply if the fighter is 
p - helpless
p - stunned
p - , or 
p - unconscious
p - Armored Master
p - : The fighter gains an 
p - armor mastery
p -  feat or a 
p - shield mastery
p -  feat as a bonus feat. He must meet all of the feat’s prerequisites.
p - Armored Sacrifice (Ex)
p - : When damage would cause the fighter or an adjacent ally to be knocked 
p - unconscious
p -  or killed, the fighter can instead direct the damage to a suit of armor that he is wearing or a shield he is using as an 
p - immediate action
p - . The original target takes no damage, but the armor or shield is treated as if it had only half its normal 
p - hardness
p - . The fighter can use this option once per day, plus one additional time each day at 11th level and every 8 fighter levels thereafter, to a maximum of three times per day at 19th level.
p - Armored Sprint (Ex)
p - : The fighter gains 
p - Run
p -  as a bonus feat. If the fighter is proficient with heavy 
p - armor
p - , he treats heavy armor as if it were one category lighter for the purpose of determining how fast he can move while running in armor.
p - Critical Deflection (Ex)
p - : While wearing armor or using a shield, the fighter gains a +2 bonus to his AC against 
p - attack rolls
p -  made to confirm a 
p - critical hit
p - . This bonus increases by 1 at 7th level and every 4 fighter levels thereafter, to a maximum of +6 at 19th level.
p - Master Armorer (Ex)
p - : The fighter can use his 
p - base attack bonus
p -  in place of his ranks in the 
p - Craft
p -  (armor) skill. The fighter need not be wearing armor or using a shield to use this option. The fighter substitutes his total 
p - base attack bonus
p -  (including his 
p - base attack bonus
p -  gained through levels in other classes) for his ranks in this skill, but adds the skill’s usual ability score modifier and any other bonuses or penalties that would modify that skill. Additionally the fighter is treated as having the 
p - Craft Magic Arms and Armor
p -  and 
p - Master Craftsman
p -  feats, but only for the purpose of making magic armor. The fighter does not need to meet these feats’ prerequisites.
p - Quick Donning (Ex)
p - : The fighter can don armor in a hurry without reducing its effectiveness, and remove it quickly when it becomes a hindrance. When the fighter dons or removes his armor or dons it hastily, the amount of time needed to do so is reduced, as noted on the table below. Other characters can still help the fighter don his armor as normal
p - Additionally, when wearing hastily donned 
p - armor
p - , the fighter can attempt a 
p - Strength
p -  or 
p - Dexterity
p -  check as a 
p - full-round action
p -  to remove the penalties associated with wearing hastily donned armor (DC = 10 + his armor’s unmodified 
p - armor bonus
p - ). If he succeeds at the check, he is treated as having properly donned his armor rather than having hastily donned it. The fighter can also remove his armor in the same amount of time that it takes him to don his armor hastily. He can even remove sections of armor to escape grapples and similar grasping hindrances. Whenever the fighter attempts a 
p - combat maneuver
p -  check, an 
p - Escape Artist
p -  check, or a 
p - Strength
p -  check to escape from an effect that reduces or restricts his ability to move or act, he can reduce the 
p - armor bonus
p -  of any armor that he is wearing by up to half his armor’s base 
p - armor bonus
p - . If he does so, he gains a bonus on his check equal to the amount by which he reduced his armor’s 
p - armor bonus
p - . Multiple uses of this ability cannot reduce the armor’s 
p - armor bonus
p -  below half its base 
p - armor bonus
p - , and the reduction to the armor’s 
p - armor bonus
p -  lasts until the fighter recovers and dons the removed pieces of armor.
p - Steel Headbutt (Ex)
p - : While wearing medium or heavy 
p - armor
p - , a fighter can deliver a headbutt with his helm as part of a full attack action. This headbutt is in addition to his normal attacks, and is made using the fighter’s 
p - base attack bonus
p -  – 5. A helmet headbutt deals 1d3 points of damage if the fighter is wearing medium 
p - armor
p - , or 1d4 points of damage if he is wearing heavy armor (1d2 and 1d3, respectively, for Small creatures), plus an amount of damage equal to 1/2 the fighter’s 
p - Strength
p -  modifier. Treat this attack as a weapon attack made using the same special material (if any) as the armor. The armor’s 
p - enhancement bonus
p -  does not modify the headbutt attack, but the helm can be enchanted as a separate weapon.
p - Unmoving (Ex)
p - : Select one 
p - combat maneuver
p -  (except 
p - sunder
p - ). Whether using his armor as leverage against a 
p - grappling
p -  foe or using its weight to help him stop a 
p - bull rush
p - , a fighter can use his armor to protect him from the chosen 
p - combat maneuver
p - . While wearing armor or wielding a shield, the fighter gains a bonus to his 
p - CMD
p -  against the chosen 
p - combat maneuver
p - . The bonus is +1 if he’s wearing light 
p - armor
p - , +2 if he’s wearing medium 
p - armor
p - , and +3 if he’s wearing heavy armor. This bonus increases by 1 at 7th level and every 4 fighter levels thereafter, to a maximum at 19th level of +5 for light 
p - armor
p - , +6 for medium 
p - armor
p - , and +7 for heavy armor. 
p - Mithral
p -  armor provides a bonus 1 lower than normal for armor of its type
p - Source
p - PPC:WMH
p - Highly skilled and experienced fighters can gain advanced weapon training, learning techniques and applications of the weapon training class feature that give them special benefits in exchange for specializing in a smaller number of fighter weapon groups.
p - Beginning at 9th level, instead of selecting an additional fighter weapon group, a fighter can choose an advanced weapon training option for one fighter weapon group that he previously selected with the weapon training class feature.
p - The fighter’s weapon training bonus still increases for weapons from all fighter weapon groups he previously selected with weapon training. A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from this group. This bonus also applies to the fighter’s Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group.
p - Some advance weapon training options can be selected only if the fighter meets the option’s prerequisites.
p - Advanced weapon training options function only when the fighter is wielding a weapon from the associated group, unless otherwise noted, and use his weapon training bonus for the associated weapon group. Any bonuses on 
p - attack rolls
p -  and damage rolls granted by advanced weapon training apply only on 
p - attack rolls
p -  and damage rolls from weapons in the associated group. A fighter with an archetype that replaces weapon training cannot select advanced weapon training options.
p - Abundant Tactics (Ex)
p -  The fighter adds his weapon training bonus to the number of times per day he can use a 
p - combat feat
p -  he has that allows a limited number of daily uses, such as the 
p - Stunning Fist
p -  feat.
p - Armed Bravery (Ex)
p -  The fighter applies his bonus from 
p - bravery
p -  to 
p - Will
p -  saving throws. In addition, the DC of 
p - Intimidate
p -  checks to demoralize him increases by an amount equal to twice his bonus from 
p - bravery
p - . The fighter must have the 
p - bravery
p -  class feature in order to select this option.
p - Combat Competence (Ex)
p -  For any weapon in the associated weapon group with which the fighter is not proficient, the penalty on 
p - attack rolls
p -  taken as a result of not being proficient is reduced by an amount equal to the fighter’s weapon training bonus with that weapon group. Once the penalty is reduced to 0, the fighter becomes proficient with such weapons.
p - Combat Maneuver Defense (Ex)
p -  When the fighter is wielding weapons from the associated weapon group, his weapon training bonus applies to his 
p - CMD
p -  against all 
p - combat maneuvers
p -  attempted against him, instead of just against 
p - disarm
p -  and 
p - sunder
p - combat maneuvers
p - Dazzling Intimidation (Ex)
p -  The fighter applies his weapon training bonus to 
p - Intimidate
p -  checks and can attempt an 
p - Intimidate
p -  check to demoralize an opponent as a 
p - move action
p -  instead of a 
p - standard action
p - . If he has the 
p - Dazzling Display
p -  feat, he can use it as a 
p - standard action
p -  instead of a 
p - full-round action
p - Defensive Weapon Training (Ex)
p -  The fighter gains a +1 
p - shield bonus
p -  to his 
p - Armor Class
p - . The fighter adds half his weapon’s 
p - enhancement bonus
p -  (if any) to this 
p - shield bonus
p - . When his weapon training bonus for weapons from the associated fighter weapon group reaches +4, this 
p - shield bonus
p -  increases to +2. This 
p - shield bonus
p -  is lost if the fighter is immobilized or 
p - helpless
p - Effortless Dual-Wielding (Ex)
p -  The fighter treats all one-handed weapons that belong to the associated weapon group as though they were light weapons when determining his penalties on 
p - attack rolls
p -  for fighting with two weapons. 
p - Source
p - PPC:BotB
p - Fighter’s Finesse (Ex)
p -  The fighter gains the benefits of the 
p - Weapon Finesse
p -  feat with all melee weapons that belong to the associated fighter weapon group (even if they cannot normally be used with 
p - Weapon Finesse
p - ). The fighter must have the 
p - Weapon Finesse
p -  feat before choosing this option.
p - Fighter’s Reflexes (Ex)
p -  The fighter applies his weapon training bonus to 
p - Reflex

The allies’ positioning and actions must still meet the prerequisites listed in the teamwork feat for the fighter to receive the listed bonus.
p - Focused Weapon (Ex)
p -  The fighter selects one weapon for which he has 
p - Weapon Focus
p -  and that belongs to the associated fighter weapon group. The fighter can deal damage with this weapon based on the damage of the warpriest’s sacred weapon class feature, treating his fighter level as his warpriest level. The fighter must have

p - fear
p -  effect that causes the ally to 
p - cower
p -  or to become 
p - frightened
p - panicked
p - , or 
p - shaken
p - . If the ally succeeds at the save, the effect ends. A fighter can use this option even when not wielding a weapon from the associated weapon group.

p -  to make a melee attack with a weapon, using his 
p - Dexterity

p -  in order to choose this option.
p - Trained Initiative (Ex)
p -  As long as he is wielding a weapon from the associated weapon group or is able to draw such a weapon (even if he is not currently wielding it), the fighter applies his weapon training bonus to

p -  checks. In addition, if he has the 
p - Quick Draw

p - free action
p -  as part of making an 
p - initiative
p -  check.

p -  The fighter can use his 
p - base attack bonus
p -  in place of his ranks in two skills of his choice that are associated with the fighter weapon group he has chosen with this option (see below). The fighter need not be wielding an associated weapon to use this option. When using versatile training, the fighter substitutes his total 
p - base attack bonus
p -  (including his 
p - base attack bonus
p -  gained through levels in other classes) for his ranks in these skills, but adds the skill’s usual ability score modifier and any other bonuses or penalties that would modify those skills. Once the skills have been selected, they cannot be changed and the fighter can immediately retrain all of his skill ranks in the selected skills at no additional cost in money or time. In addition, the fighter adds all skills chosen with this option to his list of class skills. A fighter can choose this option up to two times. The

While wielding this weapon, he can spend 1 point of spiritual energy to grant the weapon an 
p - enhancement bonus
p -  equal to his weapon training bonus. Enhancement bonuses gained by this advanced weapon training option stack with those of the weapon, to a maximum of +5. The fighter can also imbue the weapon with any one weapon special ability with an equivalent 
p - enhancement bonus
p -  less than or equal to his maximum bonus by reducing the granted 
p - enhancement bonus
p -  by the amount of the equivalent 
p - enhancement bonus
p - . The item must have an 
p - enhancement bonus
p -  of at least +1 (from the item itself or from warrior spirit) to gain a weapon special ability. In either case, these bonuses last for 1 minute.

p - PZO9468
p - Weapon Mastery
p -  The fighter gains a 
p - weapon mastery
p -  feat as a bonus feat, even when not wielding a weapon from the appropriate weapon group. He must meet all of the feat’s prerequisites.
p - Weapon Sacrifice (Ex)
p -  When damage would cause the fighter or an adjacent ally to be knocked 
p - unconscious
p -  or killed, as a swift or 
p - immediate action
p -  the fighter can instead direct the damage to a weapon from the associated weapon group that he is wielding. The original target takes no damage, but the weapon receives only half its normal 
p - hardness
p - . The fighter can use this option a number of times per day equal to the fighter’s weapon training bonus with the associated weapon group. He cannot use this option with unarmed attacks.
p - Weapon Specialist (Ex)
p -  The fighter selects a number of 
p - combat feats
p -  that he knows equal to his weapon training bonus with the associated weapon group. The selected feats must be ones that require the fighter to choose a type of weapon (such as 
p - Weapon Focus
p -  and 
p - Weapon Specialization
p - ), and the fighter must have chosen weapons that belong to the associated fighter weapon group. The fighter is treated as having the selected feats for all the weapons in the associated weapon group that are legal choices for those feats. The fighter is also considered to have those feats with these weapons for the purpose of meeting prerequisites.
p - Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, some races have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored classes. The following options are available to the listed race who have fighter as their favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the listed favored class reward.
p - When a character selects a class, he must choose to use the standard class features found or those listed in one of the archetypes presented here. Each alternate class feature replaces a specific class feature from its parent class. For example, the elemental fist class feature of the monk of the four winds replaces the stunning fist class feature of the monk. When an archetype includes multiple class features, a character must take all of them—often blocking the character from ever gaining certain familiar class features, but replacing them with equally powerful options. All of the other class features found in the core class and not mentioned among the alternate class features remain unchanged and are acquired normally when the character reaches the appropriate level (unless noted otherwise). A character who takes an alternate class feature does not count as having the class feature that was replaced when meeting any requirements or prerequisites.
p - A character can take more than one archetype and garner additional alternate class features, but none of the alternate class features can 
p - replace or alter the same class feature
p -  from the core class as another alternate class feature. For example, a paladin could not be both a hospitaler and an undead scourge since they both modify the smite evil class feature and both replace the aura of justice class feature. A paladin could, however, be both an undead scourge and a warrior of the holy light, since none of their new class features replace the same core class feature.
p - Presented below are several classic fighter archetypes and alternate class features to help you in building your character.
